## Theoretical part 


* ### Foreign key:
    * the connection between tables

* ### Normalization:
    * Division of attributes into several relations (tables)
    
    * Redundancy-free data storage
    
    * Anomaly removal
    
        * **insert:** input faults (to much, to less, wrong)
        * **update:** modification faults
        * **delete:** deleting faults  
                  
    * 5 Normal-forms
    
    * 3rd Normal-form = Balance of Redundancy, Performance and Flexibility
    
    * Dependencies:
    
        * functional dependency
        
        * full functional dependency
        
        * transitive dependency
